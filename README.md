# PlantLifeCycle

My current prototype system. Makes adding complex items such as a plant with a full life cycle easy and straighforward. With in 5 mins i can add a new plant and it will grow and complete a lifecycle leaving offspring that will do the same. 


This is an example of my current prototyping system. It is simple and easy to use.
Just right click in the file area on unity and go to the prototypes
tab. Then click on the prototype you would like to make.

Then it is as easy as filling in the fields. Make a new game object for 
each stage by duplicating one of the other ones and changing the sprite.
on the plant set new fruit spawn points if you wish. Then drag on drop 
these on to your prototype where appropriate and fill in the information
for the different stages. 

And its done. other then making sure it spawns its ready to go.
